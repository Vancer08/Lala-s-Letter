		To my dearest Lala,
            </p>
            <p>
                I saw everything in your eyes, and I knew I was locked in. I love you so much Lala, I really do.
                I think saying I love you is quite an understatement. I feel like my feelings are much greater and
                deeper than the words "I love you" could ever express. But whenever I say I love you, I truly mean it
                from the bottom of my heart. More than those three words depict itself. You have given me the most joy
                and love I could ever ask for, and you give it to me unconditionally knowing you are always there for
                me. You have given me the warmest and safest place ever in your hugs and kisses. You have brought
                colour to my lifeless void and walked with me through the darkness.
            </p>
            <p>
                There will always be more ways to tell you I love you, and I will keep on discovering them and do it
                for you. Do remember my love I will always be here for you, I will wipe your tears, offer my shoulder
                for you to rest, you can run to me and welcome you with open arms, I will catch spiders for you, I
                will work hard for us, I will always be here and support you.
                No matter what happens, I love you unconditionally, you can always run back to me. I truly believe our
                souls are forever intertwined, you will always have a special place in my heart.
            </p>
            <p>
                I bought you these earrings because it reminded me of you. Small yet eye-catching, sweet like a
                strawberry, and glistening whenever I look at them just like the way your eyes shine whenever I look
                at them.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know this letter is very messy and have ideas all over the place and poor handwriting, but these are
                the thoughts and the voice of the heart for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love you Lala, Monay, bebu, Love, Lyka, Anne, Paed, Sarino, Ly-Anne, my mini me!
